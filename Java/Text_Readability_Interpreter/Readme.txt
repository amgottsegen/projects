1b.  Installation

You MUST have Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn installed to 
play Throne of Bhaal.  If you have uninstalled Baldur's 
Gate II and want to install Throne of Bhaal, you must first 
reinstall BGII: SoA and then install Throne of Bhaal.

Insert the Throne of Bhaal CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive and 
follow the onscreen instructions.  If your Autorun is disabled, 
find the baldur.exe application in the root your CD-ROM and 
double click to launch the Installer.

During the Throne of Bhaal installation, you may be asked to 
insert CD2 from Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.  This step is 
needed in order to copy required data from that CD.  

Minimum Install versus Full install:
A minimum install represents the base information required to be 
on the hard drive to play. A full install includes more 
information than a minimum install, resulting in smoother 
performance.  For example, some character voices and monster 
animations are stored on the hard drive in a full install, which 
speeds up game performance.  You must leave the CD in the drive 
at all times when playing with a minimum install.

Note: DO NOT install the BGII patch AFTER you have installed 
Throne of Bhaal. All of the patch fixes have already been added 
into Throne of Bhaal. This will not affect previously patched 
BGII.
