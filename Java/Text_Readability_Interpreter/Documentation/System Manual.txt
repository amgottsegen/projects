Program: DifficultyMachine.java

This program reads a text file and interprets the difficulty level based on several measures of readability.

The program counts the number of sentences, words, syllables, and polysyllabic words (here defined as greater than or equal to three syllables).

It then inputs this information into the following equations:

Flesch Reading Ease Score = 206.835 - 84.6 * (Number of Syllables) / (Number of Words) - 1.015 * (Number of Words) / (Number of Sentences)

Flesch-Kincaid Reading Age = 11.8* (Number of Syllables) / (Number of Words) + 0.39 * (Number of Words) / (Number of Sentences) - 15.59

Simple Measure Of Gobbledygook Readability Formula Indicator =  (Number of Polysyllables) / (Number of Sentences) * 30

The SMOG Indicator is then processed to find the closest perfect square, and the square root of that number plus 3 is the final SMOG value.
